eBay::API::XML::Call::AddOrder::AddOrderRequestType

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Combines two or more transactions into a single order, enabling a buyer
to pay for all of those transactions with a single payment (and, if
so arranged, ship all of the items together).
<br><br>
Strong recommendation: avoid mixing digital and non-digital listings in the same order.
(In the future, AddOrder may enforce this recommendation.)
