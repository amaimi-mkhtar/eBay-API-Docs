=head1 DESCRIPTION



=head1 SYNOPSIS


=cut

=head1 Subroutines:


=cut

=head2 setIncludeCrossPromotion()

Specifies whether or not to include cross-promotion information for
the item in the call response.
<br><br>
With a request version of 485 or higher, the default is false (do not
include cross-promotion details). Set to true to retrieve cross-promotion
information for the item. Cross-promotion information is returned in
Item.CrossPromotion.PromotedItem.PromotionDetails.
A promoted item will now contain multiple PromotionDetails containers.
<br><br>
With a request version lower than 485, the default is true (include
cross-promotions). Set the value to false if you do not want to retrieve
cross-promotion information. Cross-promotion information, PromotedPrice
and PromotedPriceType, are returned in Item.CrossPromotion.PromotedItem.
If a promoted item has multiple PromotedPriceType and PromotedPrice value
pairs, only the last pair is returned.

  RequiredInput: No
#    Argument: 'xs:boolean'


=cut

=head2 setIncludeExpressRequirements()

Indicates if the response should include detailed information relating to
whether an item qualifies as an Express listing. eBay includes listings on
eBay Express under conditions described in the
eBay Web Services Guide.

=cut

=head2 setIncludeItemSpecifics()

If true, the response returns the ItemSpecifics node
(if the listing has custom Item Specifics).<br>
<br>
Item Specifics are well-known aspects of items in a given
category. For example, items in a washer and dryer category
might have an aspect like Type=Top-Loading; whereas
items in a jewelry category might have an aspect like
Gemstone=Amber.<br>
<br>
(This does not cause the response to include ID-based
attributes. To also retrieve ID-based attributes,
pass DetailLevel in the request with the value
ItemReturnAttributes or ReturnAll.)

  RequiredInput: No
