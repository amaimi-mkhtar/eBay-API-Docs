=head2 setIncludeRESTToken()

Specified if you want to retrieve a REST token for a user.

  RequiredInput: No
#    Argument: 'xs:boolean'


=cut

=head2 setSecretID()

A value that is associated with the token retrieval request. SecretID
is defined by the application, and is passed in redirect
URL to the eBay signin page. eBay recommends using a UUID for the secret
ID value. You must also set Username (part of the RequesterCredentials)
for the particular user of interest. SecretID and Username are not
required if SessionID is present.

  RequiredInput: No
#    Argument: 'xs:string'


=cut

=head2 setSessionID()

A value that is associated with the token retrieval request. The session ID
is generated by eBay by the application making GetSessionID call, and is passed in redirect
URL to the eBay signin page. The advantage of using SessionID is that it
does not require UserID as part of the FetchToken request. SessionID is not required
if SecretID is present.

  RequiredInput: No
#    Argument: 'xs:string'


=cut

and can no longer be used to authenticate the user for that application.
