=head2 setIncludeContainingOrder()

Whether to retrieve the order information.

#    Argument: 'xs:boolean'


=cut

=head2 setIncludeFinalValueFee()

For most listing types, the fee is returned in Transaction.FinalValueFee.
For Dutch auctions that end with bids (not Buy It Now purchases), the fee
is returned in Item.SellingStatus.FinalValueFee.
The Final Value Fee for FixedPriceItem, StoresFixedPrice, and Buy It Now
Dutch listing types is returned on a transaction by transaction basis.
For all other listing types, including Chinese and Dutch (no Buy It Now
purchases), the Final Value Fee is returned when the listing status is
Completed.

  RequiredInput: No
#    Argument: 'xs:boolean'


=cut

=head2 setModTimeFrom()

Also see NumberOfDays which, if used, takes precedence over ModTimeFrom and
ModTimeTo. If you prefer to use ModTimeFrom and
ModTimeTo, you specify the time range within which
retrieved transactions' statuses were modified.
ModTimeFrom is the earlier (older) date and ModTimeTo is the later (more recent) date.
If you specify this value, and do not specify the other end of the range,
then the time range is 30 days.
The time range between ModTimeFrom to ModTimeTo
cannot be greater than 30 days.

  RequiredInput: No
#    Argument: 'xs:dateTime'


=cut

=head2 setModTimeTo()

Also see NumberOfDays which, if used, takes precedence over ModTimeFrom and
ModTimeTo. If you prefer to use ModTimeFrom and
ModTimeTo, you specify the time range within which
retrieved transactions' statuses were modified.
ModTimeFrom is the earlier (older) date and ModTimeTo is the later (more recent) date.
If you specify this value, and do not specify the other end of the range,
then the time range is 30 days.
The time range between ModTimeFrom to ModTimeTo
cannot be greater than 30 days.

  RequiredInput: No
#    Argument: 'xs:dateTime'


=cut

=head2 setNumberOfDays()

NumberOfDays enables you to specify the number of days' worth
of new and modified transactions that you want to retrieve.
The call response contains the transactions
whose status was modified within the
specified number of days since the API call was made.
NumberOfDays is often preferable to using
the ModTimeFrom and ModTimeTo filters because you only need to specify
one value.
If you use NumberOfDays, then ModTimeFrom and ModTimeTo are ignored.
For this field, one day is defined as 24 hours.

Max: 30

  RequiredInput: No
#    Argument: 'xs:int'
