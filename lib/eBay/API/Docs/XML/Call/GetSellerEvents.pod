=head2 setUserID()

eBay user ID for the seller whose events are to be returned.
If not specified, retrieves events for the user identified by
the authentication token passed in the request. Note that since user information is anonymous to everyone except the bidder and the seller (during an active auction), only sellers looking for information about
their own listings and bidders who know the user IDs of their sellers
will be able to make this API call successfully. See <a href="http://developer.ebay.com/DevZone/XML/docs/WebHelp/index.htm?context=eBay_XML_API&topic=AnonymousUserInfo">Working with Anonymous User Information</a>in the eBay Web Services Guide for more information.

  RequiredInput: No
#    Argument: 'ns:UserIDType'

=head2 getItemArray()

Collection of Item objects, each of which represents an item listing
that incurred the type of seller event change specified in the call's
inputs. Returns empty if the seller has no item events within the
time window indicated in the request.

  Returned: Always
  Details: DetailLevel: none, ReturnAll
#    Returns: 'ns:ItemArrayType'


=cut

=head2 getTimeTo()

Indicates the latest (most recent) date for any date-based filtering specified as
input. Specifically, this field contains the value you specified in the StartTimeTo, EndTimeTo, or ModTimeTo filter, if you used a time filter in the request. If no time filter was specified, TimeTo returns the current time.

  Returned: Always
