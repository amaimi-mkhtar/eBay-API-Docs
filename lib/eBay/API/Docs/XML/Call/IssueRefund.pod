=head1 Methods


=cut

=head2 setItemID()

ID of the Half.com item associated with the refund payment to the buyer.
To uniquely identify a transaction, you need to specify both ItemID
and TransactionID. Use GetSellerPayments to determine the item ID
and transaction ID associated with the original sale payment.

MaxLength: 19 (Note: The eBay database specifies 38. Currently, Item IDs are usually 9 to 12 digits)

  RequiredInput: Yes
#    Argument: 'ns:ItemIDType'


=cut

=head2 setRefundAmount()

The amount the seller wants to refund to the buyer, in US Dollars (USD).
Must be greater than 0.00. Half.com allows a maximum of the original item
sale price (transaction price plus original shipping reimbursement) plus
return shipping costs (the amount the buyer paid to return the item).
Typically, the return shipping cost is based on the current cost of
shipping the individual item (not the discounted cost calculated during
the original checkout for a multi-item order). You can also issue a
partial refund for the amount you want the buyer to receive. If
RefundType=Full or RefundType=FullPlusShipping and you do not pass
RefundAmount in the request, Half.com will calculate the refund amount for
you. If you pass RefundAmount in the request, the amount you specify will
override Half.com's calculated value. Required if RefundType=
CustomOrPartial.

  RequiredInput: Conditionally
#    Argument: 'ns:AmountType'
