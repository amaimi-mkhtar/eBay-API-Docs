=head1 Methods


=cut

=head2 setCategoryVersion()

A version of the category mapping for the site. Filters
out data from the call to return only the category
mappings for which the data has changed since the
specified version. If not specified, all category
mappings are returned. Typically, an application passes
the version value of the last set of category mappings
that the application stored locally. The latest version
value is not necessarily greater than the previous value
that was returned. Therefore, when comparing versions,
only compare whether the value has changed.
