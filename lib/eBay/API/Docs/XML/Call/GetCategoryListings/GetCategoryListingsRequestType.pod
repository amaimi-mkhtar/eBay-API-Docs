=head1 NAME

eBay::API::XML::Call::GetCategoryListings::GetCategoryListingsRequestType

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Returns items in a specified category. A number of inputs are provided
for filtering the item listings returned using such criteria as
location, whether the item is listed in an ebay Store,
the listing type, and including or excluding specified sellers.
<p>It is recommended that you consider using FindItemsAdvanced
(in the Shopping API) instead of GetCategoryListings because
FindItemsAdvanced is easier to use and faster.
See <a href="http://developer.ebay.com/products/shopping/" target="_blank">Shopping API</a>
for more information.

Title: Searching by Category ID
MaxLength: 10

  RequiredInput: Yes
#    Argument: 'xs:string'


=cut

=head2 getCategoryID()

#    Returns: 'xs:string'


=cut

=head2 setCurrency()

A currency value. Limits the result set to just those items listed
using a specified currency. Not applicable to US eBay Motors searches.

  RequiredInput: No
#    Argument: 'ns:CurrencyCodeType'


=cut

=head2 getCurrency()

#    Returns: 'ns:CurrencyCodeType'


=cut

=head2 setFreeShipping()

If true, only items with free shipping for the user's location are
returned. The user's location is determined from the site ID specified
in the request. If false, no filtering is done via this attribute. A
listing is not considered a free shipping listing if it requires
insurance or requires pick up or requires a shipping surcharge.

Default: false

  RequiredInput: No
#    Argument: 'xs:boolean'


=cut

=head2 isFreeShipping()

#    Returns: 'xs:boolean'


=cut

=head2 setGroup()

You can group Best Match search results by category. To group
by category, put the BestMatchCategoryGroup value
in the OrderBy field.
When you use the BestMatchCategoryGroup value,
you can include group
parameters in your call. Note
that there will be significanty fewer results returned with a BestMatchCategoryGroup sort because the results account
for Best Matches in lower-level
(leaf) as well as higher-level categories.
There is not a direct correlation between the number of results returned in a regular sort or
the number of results returned with a BestMatch sort, and the results that are returned by
the BestMatchCategoryGroup sort. You should not receive more
than 2 pages of results with
this type of sort. See also
the new GroupCategoryID element
in ItemType.

  RequiredInput: No
#    Argument: 'ns:GroupType'


=cut

=head2 getGroup()

#    Returns: 'ns:GroupType'


=cut

=head2 setIncludeCondition()

If true, each item in the result set can also include the item
condition (whether the item is new or used).
The item's condition is returned in Item.AttributeSetArray.
An item only includes condition attribute if the item's seller
filled in the Item Condition in the Item Specifics section of the
listing. (That is, the condition is not returned if the seller
only put the word "New" in the listing's title.)

  RequiredInput: No
#    Argument: 'xs:boolean'


=cut

=head2 isIncludeCondition()

#    Returns: 'xs:boolean'

seller's feedback.

#    Returns: 'xs:boolean'


=cut

=head2 setItemTypeFilter()
