=head2 getPolicyCompliance()

Rates how well you are following eBay rules and policies in your selling,
and alerts you to any account or listing policy violations.
eBay's policies are rules and guidelines that help 
to create a safe, fair, and enjoyable trading environment for all eBay members. 
If you violate certain policies, your account may be restricted
without notice. This is true even if your status shows a good level of 
policy compliance. 
Therefore, understanding and following eBay's policies can help you to avoid 
restrictions on your account. 
Your policy compliance status directly affects your PowerSeller status.

PowerSeller requirements. Your PowerSeller status directly affects your discount

=head2 getSearchStanding()

Provides information about the visibility level you've earned for your listings.

is an important way for eBay to reward you as a good seller, 
and to encourage you to give buyers the best possible shopping experience.
